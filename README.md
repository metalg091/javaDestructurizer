# Java Destructurizer

This is a tool that converts java structure test (give on java exams in ELTE) to the skeleton of the java Project. It:

- creates the files
- sets packages
- creates classes, interfaces
- sets inheritance, implements
- properties with auto setter/getter generation
- creates the empty methods
- and so on...

## Please drop a **Star** if you found it useful

# Usage:
Place the main.cpp and the generate.sh in the same folder. Place them in a director so that all the structure tests are in the same or a sub-directory. Then just start the generat.sh and enjoy. For more manual usage compile the program, and give the file as a parameter!

# PLEASE REPORT ANY UNCOVERED CASES!!!

Submit them through github as an issue it makes it easier to handle!
Also, attach the failing test-file!

# Contributing:

### Read the Project to avoid working on the same problem multiple times!

**KEEP IT SIMPLE!** I'm not very good at coding and if I don't understand what your code does I'm not merging.
Feel free to upload any and every official structure test you can find to the test folder!
Also, do not insult the code or the style in any way plz!
