# Java Structurizer
This is a tool that converts java structure test (give on java exams in ELTE) to the skeleton of the java Project. It:
  - creates the files
  - sets packages
  - creates classes, interfacees
  - sets inheritance, implemets
  - properties with auto setter/getter generation
  -  creates the empty methodes
  -  and so on...

# PLEASE REPORT ANY UNCOVERED CASES!!!
Submit them through github as an issue it makes it easier to handle!
Also attach the failing test-file!

__KEEP IT SIMPLE!__ I'm not very good at coding and if I don't understand what your code does I'm not merging.
Feel free to upload any and every official structure test you can find to the test folder!
Also do not insult the code or the style in any ways plz!
