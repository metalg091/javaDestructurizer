# Java Destructurizer
This is a tool that converts java structure test (give on java exams in ELTE) to the skeleton of the java Project. It:
  - creates the files
  - sets packages
  - creates classes, interfaces
  - sets inheritance, implements
  - properties with auto setter/getter generation
  -  creates the empty methods
  -  and so on...

__KEEP IT SIMPLE!__ I'm not very good at coding and if I don't understand what your code does I'm not merging.
Feel free to upload any and every official structure test you can find to the test folder!
Also, do not insult the code or the style in any way plz!
